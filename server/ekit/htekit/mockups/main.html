<BODY>
<H2>Welcome</h2>
This page provides some details of the ekit makeover assignment.
<P>On the left are links to the HTML pages to be fixed. There is some duplication, as they all use common style sheets, so for the most part fixing the style sheets will fix all the pages.
<P> Please do not follow the links on the pages (They have been disabled)

<P>The last item, Q2.new contains the new logo, and a start at doing a new style sheet, although it is not perfect (and also not finished). You'll see from that why I need help.

<P>Most of the HTML code is generated by a web application, and cannot be changed easily, so I am hoping that most of the changes can be achieved using CSS. We may need to clean up the HTML to make that easier - I'm ok with that, but the basic structure should remain the same, using HTML tables.
