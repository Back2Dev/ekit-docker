<B>Management Action Programs is looking forward to seeing you at a MAP workshop.</B></FONT></P>
<P>Prior to the workshop, we normally send you what we call a PWI Kit. 
This kit allows us to gather information about you and your work situation.
Your workshop leader will review this information prior to the workshop, and will use it to 
tailor the workshop for your personal needs.</P>

<P>We would like you to complete these forms electronically. 
We have provided the necessary forms for you to fill in and distribute 
to your manager/colleagues for their comment.</P>

<P>Our preference is that all forms are filled in electronically, 
although we have also provided the option for you to download and print them 
(see the <A HREF="/pwikit/self_assist.htm">assistance page</a>).<BR><BR>
<B>Confidentiality</B><BR>

<P>Your data will be treated with utmost care. Only you and your workshop leader will have access to it. 
Comments submitted by your peers and colleagues will not be available to you or your manager.</P>
