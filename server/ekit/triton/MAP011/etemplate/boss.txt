Dear [%who%]:

We are looking forward to working with [%aboutname%] in [%abouthisher%] upcoming management and 
leadership process through Management Action Programs (MAP).

As [%abouthisher%] supervising manager or partner, your feedback is critical in guiding 
us to help [%firstname%] achieve the goals of this program: to increase productivity and 
overall management effectiveness.   Your responses will be shared with [%firstname%] during 
the Workshop.  If there are certain comments you do not want shared, please designate those 
accordingly.  To make the process of providing this important feedback to us easier, we 
have provided a link to some online questionnaires for you to complete no later than [%duedate%]. 

It is critical that these forms are completed and returned to us by this deadline to ensure 
[%firstname%]'s successful participation in the workshop.  In addition to completing the 
Manager / Partner Questionnaire contained in the link above, please discuss with [%aboutname%]
the list of co-workers who should receive the Key Personnel Questionnaires (Q10). A copy 
of the completed Key Personnel List (Q10A) will be sent to you.

Our preference is that all forms be completed online and submitted online through this 
process; however, we have also provided the option for you to download and print them and 
then fax to us at 818-981-2717. 

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to give us a call at 818-380-1177 x225, 
or reply to this email.  Thank you, and we look forward to working with [%firstname%]! 

Sincerely,

[%execname%]
