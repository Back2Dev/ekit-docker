Dear <%firstname%>:

Thank you very much for taking the time to participate in MAP’s post workshop survey. Your suggestions and comments are highly valued and will be used to improve our services to you.

During the workshop, you heard about the MAP Alumni Network, our online service exclusively for MAP clients. I encourage you to register today, and take advantage of the Alumni Network to further your MAP education and consult with the extensive network of MAP alums.

To register and log in, to our website (http://www.mapconsulting.com/) and click on the Alumni Network button. Your USERID is <%uid%> and your PASSWORD is <%apwd%> (Please remember, your password is case sensitive.) If, for whatever reason, you experience difficulties activating your Alumni account, please email ctwebb@mapconsulting.com.

Thank you very much for your help. Your suggestions and comments are highly valued and will be used to improve our services to you.
