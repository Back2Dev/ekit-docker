<h3>Your Hotel</H3>
<P>You'll be staying at the Marriott Suites, Newport at 500 Bayview Circle, Newport Beach. We're enclosing a map that shows how to get to Newport Beach.

<h3>Your Conference Package</h3>

You will be expected to pay this to the hotel when you check out. Any additional nights stay, parking, and all incidentals, are an additional cost to you. Although lodging is not a requirement, due to the full schedule, it is recommended. A conference package without lodging is available. Please see the attached reservation form.

<h3>Confirming Your Accommodations</h3>

However, if you have a guest, he or she is welcome to join the group for the social hour and dinner - at an additional cost to you. Please let us know on the enclosed form.

<h3>If You Reschedule Your Workshop</h3>
<p>If you are unable to participate in the workshop scheduled above, you must notify us in writing at least 7 days before that date or there will be a $500 reschedule fee. In addition, late cancellation of hotel reservations may incur hotel charges.

<h3>Workshop Start Time</h3>
